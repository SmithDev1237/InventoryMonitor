# InventoryMonitor
An Ashita V4 addon for FFXI that allows you to set items to monitor in your inventory.
Useful for seeing how shihei or bolts you have left so you don't run out mid-fight.
I play on the HorizonXI so I don't know how well this will work on retail.

You can add item IDs via the config to tell it what to monitor. For example, it can show the quantities and charges remaining on things like warp cudgels.
